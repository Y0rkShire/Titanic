This repository contains my approach to the Titanic dataset challenge on Kaggle. The goal of this project is to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques.

Key Features:

Data Exploration: Thorough analysis and visualization of passenger data.

Feature Engineering: Creation of meaningful features to improve model performance.

Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Evaluation: Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

Files Included:

Test.csv and Train.csv
Both of which very intuitive where they were used.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn
